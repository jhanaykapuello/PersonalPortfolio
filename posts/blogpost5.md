Analyzed financial data in Excel for Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Caterpillar, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble Stocks.  

The S&P 500 index was used as a benchmark to determine the volatility of each stock by calculating their betas.  

A regression analysis was also made to measure how much of the return for each stock depends on the market’s performance.
