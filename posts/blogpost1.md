Led a team of 4 students as a project manager to develop a bus tracking website for the NJ Transit Authority.  

The website was coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and SQL. GTFS data was handled with phpMyAdmin, and maps and routes were displayed using Google Transit API.  

To manage the project, Microsoft Project and Trello were used.  

The project was presented to stakeholders and a Capstone Champion recommendation letter was received from the Professor and Director of the Computer Science School Capstone program at NJIT.
