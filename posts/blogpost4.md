Developed a Marketing Calendar on Google Sheets alongside 5 peers for League Network as a part of a Marketing Plan to advertise the 2018 TLC Sports Summit happening in 4 states.  

Project was pitched to the client. The client chose our calendar to implement the strategies and rewarded each team member with a $50 Amex card.  

Simultaneously and alongside the same team, developed an Integrated Marketing Communications Plan for NJIT’s Business School to inform the target market about the school’s offerings, benefits and graduate programs.  

The main focus of the strategies was on the school's website. My contributions to the project were the marketing objectives and the strategies.
